# Hypermesh_Guide

This project is a collaborative effort with contributions by Jen A. Bright, Eva C. Herbst, Stephan Lautenschlager, and Andrew R. Cuff.

This project contains three files designed to help beginners get started with (palaeo)biological meshing in the software HyperMesh (Altair). The HyperMesh software is not free, but there is a free student version for models under a certain size.

"HyperMesh Fun Sheet 2021.pdf" contains a detailed guide for mesh editing written by Jen, Eva, and Stephan. It does not advocate best practice or explain the finite element method, rather, it should be seen as a practical 'how to' to help folks get started

"HyperMesh Fun Guide.pptx" contains a pictoral guide to the processes in the pdf, written by Andrew. Note that the images are based on v11.0 of HyperMesh, so are slightly out of date, and some menu organisation has changed compared to the pdf and what you will see in the latest editions of HyperMesh.

"PigModel.hm" is a HyperMesh model of a pig skull that can used for practice. *This model is too big to host on github, so you can download it via google drive [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lJ0g7VEtlw2RgzJ5wfUJGEdp9o8i8XKU/view?usp=sharing)*. This model is a version of the geometry used in various models made by Jen, in Emily Rayfield's lab at the University of Bristol. The model has been deliberately 'broken' to illustrate some of the most common meshing errors users are most likely to encounter. The following publications use higher quality meshes (with various alterations to the boundary conditions to test validity, sensitivity, and convergence of the models) of the same geometry:
